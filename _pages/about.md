## <i class="fas fa-graduation-cap"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;My Research Direction

In the past few years, my reserach interest focuses on **code generation** and **pretrained language model (PLM)**:
* Code Generation: focusing on techniques to improve the performance of generating code.
* pretrained language model: aiming to design the pretraining objectives and pre-train a useful PLM on variety of downstream tasks.
